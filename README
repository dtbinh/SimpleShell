Description:

Simple shell I made for my Operating Systems class.
You can run all your usual commands from it, including 
running programs in the background by using "&" at the end
of the line. Also supports piping and redirecting, but only 
one per command. 

Usage:

To build use the included makefile with the default target.

> make

Program compiles as "shell" so usage is /path/to/shell.
